# **Mocktail** üçπ

**Next-generation test automation for modern developers**

## Accelerate Test Creation by 10x

Mocktail analyzes your codebase and instantly generates high-quality unit and integration tests directly within VSCode. Built for developers who value code quality but need to ship faster.

Say goodbye to tedious test writing. Our Claude-powered extension helps you create comprehensive test suites in seconds, complete with mocked dependencies and edge cases that would take hours to write manually.

## Why Mocktail?

Software teams today face competing demands: ship quickly, maintain quality, and keep technical debt low. Testing is essential but time-intensive, often leading to compromises that result in bugs, regressions, and unstable codebases.

Mocktail gives you the best of both worlds ‚Äì rapid development velocity with the confidence of comprehensive test coverage. 

## Key Features

- **One-Click Test Generation** - Create complete test suites for JavaScript/TypeScript (Jest) and Python (Pytest) with a single command
- **Intelligent Context Analysis** - Automatically understands your code's intent, arguments, and edge cases
- **Dependency Mocking** - Suggests and implements appropriate mocks for external dependencies
- **Edge Case Detection** - Identifies boundary conditions and error states you might not have considered
- **Configurable Test Depth** - Choose between basic tests (happy paths), standard tests, or thorough tests with complete edge case coverage
- **Seamless Integration** - Works directly within your VSCode environment with an intuitive UI

## How It Works

Mocktail leverages Anthropic's Claude API to analyze and understand your code at a semantic level:

1. **Code Analysis** - Your selected code is analyzed for structure, purpose, and possible edge cases
2. **Context-Aware Test Generation** - Claude is prompted with expert-crafted templates optimized for different languages and test frameworks
3. **Intelligent Mocking** - Dependencies are identified and appropriate mock implementations suggested
4. **Edge Case Identification** - Potential boundary conditions and error states are recognized and tests generated for them

All of this happens in seconds, with the privacy and security you expect from modern developer tools.
