## ✨ About Mocktail

![Mocktail Demo](https://placehold.co/800x450/48507c/ffffff?text=Mocktail+Demo+Coming+Soon&font=montserrat)

Every development team faces the same challenge: **writing comprehensive tests takes time**, but skipping tests leads to bugs and regressions.

Mocktail solves this by automatically generating high-quality unit and integration tests directly in your IDE. Our Claude-powered extension:

- Analyzes your code and creates complete test suites in seconds
- Suggests appropriate mocks for all dependencies
- Identifies and tests edge cases you might have missed
- Generates tests that follow best practices for your framework

## 🚀 Key Features

- **✅ One-Click Test Generation** - Create test suites for JS/TS (Jest) and Python (Pytest) with a single command
- **🧠 Intelligent Code Analysis** - Automatically understands your code's intent and edge cases
- **🔄 Dependency Mocking** - Suggests and implements the right mocks for external dependencies
- **🔍 Edge Case Detection** - Identifies boundary conditions and error states automatically
- **⚙️ Configurable Test Depth** - Choose between basic, standard, or thorough test coverage
- **🔌 Seamless VSCode Integration** - Works in your existing workflow with an intuitive sidebar

## 🎬 Demo

Mocktail allows you to create comprehensive tests with a single click:

1. Select your code
2. Click "Generate Tests"
3. Review and save

## 🔧 How It Works

Mocktail leverages Claude's AI to understand your code at a semantic level:

1. **Code Analysis** - Your selected code is analyzed for structure and purpose
2. **Smart Test Generation** - Tests are created using proven templates for your language and framework
3. **Intelligent Mocking** - Dependencies are identified and mocked appropriately
4. **Edge Case Testing** - Boundary conditions and error states are automatically tested
